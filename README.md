# Charity Chain

In the current charitable landscape, transparency and efficiency in donations are significant challenges. Traditional donation systems often lack clear visibility into fund allocation and can be marred by inefficiencies, leading to delays and misuse of funds. Additionally, NGOs and charitable organizations frequently struggle to secure funding and provide employment opportunities due to limited financial resources and administrative overhead.

**Charity Chain aims to address these issues by leveraging the Ethereum blockchain and decentralized technologies. The project seeks to:**

- **Enhance Transparency:** Ensure that donations are traceable and verifiable through smart contracts, reducing the potential for misuse and ensuring that funds are directed to the intended recipients.
- **Improve Efficiency:** Streamline the donation process using blockchain technology, minimizing delays and administrative burdens associated with traditional donation systems.
- **Integrate Decentralized Storage:** Utilize Filecoin for secure and decentralized storage of important documents and data related to charitable activities.

## Features

Some of the notable feature provided by our dev application

- **Decentralized Donations**: Enable users to donate funds transparently over the blockchain to the other user.

## Tech Stack

- **Solidity**: Smart contract programming language used to write the contracts.
- **Hardhat**: Development environment to compile, test, and deploy smart contracts.
- **MetaMask**: Wallet used to manage private keys and interact with the DApp.
- **React**: JavaScript library for building the front-end user interface.
- **Ethers.js**: Library to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **thridweb**:Framework for smooth Dapp deployment

```Note : More  tech stack be added in the course of the development```
